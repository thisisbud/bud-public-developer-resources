  description: "# Overview\n\n## Introduction\nWelcome to Bud's API Platform documentation.\
    \ Here you will find everything you need to build features, apps and experiences\
    \ using Bud's API Services. All endpoints follow standard RESTful principles and\
    \ example request and response payload snippets are provided to get you up and\
    \ running quickly and easily.\n\nTo start interacting with our platform, please\
    \ sign up for access [here](https://www.thisisbud.com/developers#developer-console).\
    \ You will be provided with access to the [Bud Developer Console](https://console.thisisbud.com)\
    \ where you can create the API Credentials required to obtain an OAuth2 access\
    \ token.\n\nIf you have any questions, please use our [Support Centre](https://support.thisisbud.com/hc/en-gb)\
    \ or email us on [help@thisisbud.com](mailto:help@thisisbud.com).\n\n## Bud Platform\

    \ two environments on its platform:\n\n1.  Bud’s Sandbox Environment - [https://api-sandbox.thisisbud.com/](https://api-sandbox.thisisbud.com/)\n\
    \n2.  Bud’s Production Environment - [https://api.thisisbud.com/](https://api.thisisbud.com/)\n\
    \n\n## Bud’s Sandbox Environment\n\n### About\n\nBud Sandbox Platform is a development\
    \ environment for integrating and testing Bud’s services. Its version is kept\
    \ up to date with production. Bud’s sandbox environment mirrors our production\
    \ environment and all updates are made in tandem. On the Sandbox environment,\
    \ the variety of providers that you can connect to via Open Banking is limited\
    \ and contains a predefined set of dummy accounts and transaction data. The instance\
    \ size doesn’t differ from production, although certain rate limits are in place.\n\
    \n### API Access\n\nTo start interacting with Bud’s Sandbox API you have to sign\
    \ up for a developer account [here](https://www.thisisbud.com/developers#developer-console).\n\
    \nOnce you’ve completed the signup and activation process you will be able to\
    \ create a new project in the [Developer Console](https://console.thisisbud.com)\
    \ to receive API Credentials (client_id and client_secret). These can be used\
    \ to obtain OAuth2 access and refresh tokens using authentication endpoint. The\
    \ access token must be supplied as a Bearer token within every service API call\
    \ made to the Bud Platform. Once the access token has expired, the refresh token\
    \ must be used to obtain another access token.  \n\n\nDetails on the authentication\
    \ process can be found in the Authentication section of this documentation.\n\n\
    ### Sandbox Providers\n\nBud’s sandbox is built to mirror its production environment.\
    \ The main difference is the available open banking providers that a customer\
    \ is able to connect to. In the sandbox, Bud’s aggregation service only supports\
    \ the use of Open Banking sandbox providers which issue dummy data.\n\nCurrently,\
    \ you are able to connect to customer profiles with predefined accounts and transaction\
    \ data sets (managed by Bud) which are available via the NatWest Sandbox provider.\n\
    \nFrom a Marketplace perspective, you can test any available journeys and play\
    \ around with them, see how the product is constructed, what information the endpoints\
    \ return and potentially create a new product of your choosing, following the\
    \ API journey. Please note, that you will be unable to physically carry out any\
    \ of the marketplace journeys (e.g. send rental data to Experian, or switch your\
    \ Utility provider) within the Sandbox environment.\n\nNecessary access credentials\
    \ can be found in the Bud [Developer Console](https://console.thisisbud.com) interface.\n\
    \n## Bud’s Production Environment\n\n### About\n\nBud’s production environment\
    \ is designed for use within your application when going live to real Customers.\
    \ The environment is fully scalable, secure and facilitates the use of real Customer\
    \ data.\n\n### API Access\n\nTo start interacting with Bud’s Production environment\
    \ you must first sign up for a developer account [here](https://www.thisisbud.com/developers#developer-console).\
    \ Once you have been assigned a relevant account manager, please contact them\
    \ to get access to Bud’s production environment.\n\n### Providers\n\nBud’s production\
    \ environment provides live access to all currently available providers via the\
    \ Bud Platform (i.e. third party products and services). Please click here for\
    \ a list of the currently supported Open Banking providers available via Buds\
    \ Open Banking Aggregation API. This list is updated as and when new providers\
    \ are on boarded onto the Bud platform.\n\nThe production environment allows your\
    \ Customers to connect to additional third party products and services via the\
    \ Bud platform. A list of the different Investment and Pension Aggregation providers\
    \ can be seen here. Information surrounding additional third party providers,\
    \ relevant to a specific marketplace journey, can be found in the relevant documentation\
    \ below.\n\n## Message formats\n\nBud’s platform is made available through Application\
    \ Programming Interface (API) endpoints, all of which adhere to [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/)\
    \ principles. Standard HTTP verbs and status codes are used for requests and response\
    \ statuses. Request and response payloads are [JSON](http://www.json.org/) encoded\
    \ data formatted. Communication with the Bud Platform is handled over HTTPS protocol\
    \ only.\n\n| Data Type | Standard |\n| -- | -- |\n| Strings encoding | `UTF-8`\
    \ |\n| Datetime | `ISO 8601` |\n| Currency codes | `ISO 4217` |\n\n### HTTP Verbs\n\

    \ has not been processed due to client-side issue with the request |\n| `5XX`\
    \ | Server Error - the request has not been processed due to server-side issue\
    \ |\n\n## Requests Custom Headers\n\nSome endpoints will require the presence\
    \ of custom headers in the HTTP Request to be properly processed by Bud Platform\
    \ services.\n\n| Header Name | Description|\n| ----------- | ----------------------------\

    \ & Versioning\n\nUpdates to Bud's API documentation are made frequently. The\
    \ current version of the documentation can be clearly viewed at the very top of\
    \ this page.\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\nBud aims to make integration as seamless\
    \ as possible for its clients and therefore takes all possible steps to prevent\
    \ backward-compatibility breaks. In the scenario where a backward-compatibility\
    \ break is unavoidable, Bud creates a new endpoint, either: (a) by bumping the\
    \ version within the endpoint URL; or (b) in some circumstances renaming the URL\
    \ entirely. The previous endpoint may then become deprecated, and support for\
    \ the endpoint will cease after a period of three months. Clients with access\
    \ to any of Bud’s API services will be notified of deprecations to any endpoints\
    \ and provided with ample time in which to make any necessary changes.\n\nFields\
    \ within response or request schemas may also become deprecated. Along with deprecated\
    \ endpoints, these breaking changes will be clearly highlighted within the below\
    \ changelog.\n\n## Deprecations\n\nBud will continue to support deprecations for\

    **Version 2.0.0: 23/01/2023**\n> - This major release not only showcases a new\
    \ look and feel for Bud's API docs, but also some fairly significant changes to\
    \ the structure of the endpoints across the platform. In a nutshell, Bud's Connect\
    \ API (formally Open Banking Aggregation API) has a simplified structure with\
    \ the retrieve data endpoints moving into a dedicated **Financial Data** section.\
    \ In addition, the various insights endpoints have been broken down to provide\
    \ a more simplified structure within the **Financial Insights** section.\n> -\
    \ \\[**BREAKING**\\] Bud's List Transactions (**POST** _/v1/open-banking/transactions_)\
    \ has now been deprecated given the onsight of the new **List Transactions V2**\
    \ endpoint (**POST** _/financial/v2/transactions_). Given the number of clients\
    \ using the V1 endpoint, Bud has increased the deprecation window to six months.\
    \ As a result, **all support will cease for the V1 List Transactions endpoint\
    \ on the 1st of August 2023**. Please complete your migration before that date\
    \ and contact your Bud account manager for further details and any help planning\
    \ your migration.\n> - Bud's Create Customers (**POST** _/v1/customers_) has now\
    \ been deprecated. Support for this endpoint will continue, however we recommend\
    \ clients to mirgate to V2 when possible.\n\n**Version 1.22.3: 18/01/2023**\n\
    > - Improvements to __Ingest Transactions V2__ and __Ingest Transactions Task\
    \ Status__ examples.\n> - Removed the `provider` field from the __Ingest Transactions\
    \ V2__ request payload.\n> - Consolidate the List Accounts, V1 List Transactions\
    \ endpoint and Remove OB Provider endpoints into the Financial Data API (to sit\
    \ alongside the new V2 List Transactions endpoint).\n\n**Version 1.22.2: 12/01/2023**\n\
    > - \\[**BREAKING**\\] _Balances Over Time_ and _Balances Over Time By Account_\
    \ beta endpoints now provide pending and booked balances. Please note this has\
    \ changed the structure of the response. Please note, as these are beta endpoints,\
    \ normal deprecation rules don't apply.\n\n**Version 1.22.1: 10/01/2023**\n> -\
    \ General bug fixes and improvements across examples and schemas\n\n**Version\
    \ 1.22.0: 21/12/2022**\n> - Bud is looking to undergo some major improvements\
    \ to the code base of its Rent Recognition service throughout 2023 in order to\
    \ bring it in line with the other services on the Bud platform. As a result, Bud\
    \ has removed the current Rent Recognition service from its API documentation.\
    \ For further details on when the new Rent Recognition service will be available,\
    \ please contact sales@thisisbud.com or your relevant Bud account manager.\n\n\

    \n**Version 1.9.0: 14/10/2021**\n> - Addition of a new endpoint `/v2/open-banking/authorisation-gateway-url`\
    \ to allow clients to use an updated\nBud Connect flow, allowing their customer's\
    \ to go through a new Account Connection journey. The v2 journey is \nhighly configurable\
    \ via the use of different flags within the request payload.\n\n**Version 1.8.3:\
    \ 06/10/2021**\n> - General bug fixes and improvements across examples, schemas,\

    \ include latest product set.\n> - Removed deprecated Financial Assistant endpoints.\n\
    \n**Version 1.7.8: 28/05/2021**\n> - Addition of some optional fields to the POST\
    \ Retrieve Authorisation Gateway URL endpoint. The additional fields allow clients\
    \ to specify: (i) a single provider, effectively skipping the select provider\
    \ screen in the customer UI; (ii) a list of providers, allowing clients to configure\
    \ the list of providers shown to the customer on the select provider screen; and\
    \ (iii) filter the provider list shown to the customer by the type of provider\
    \ (e.g. business or personal). In addition, a `connect_more_accounts_button` flag\
    \ can be configured to show the customer a button at the end of the connection\
    \ flow that will allow them to connect to another provider without having to return\
    \ to the client application.\n\n**Version 1.7.7: 15/04/2021**\n> - Updated the\
    \ examples within Bud's KYC endpoints to make them more usable against Bud's sandbox\
    \ environment.\n> - Addition of a new GET `/v1/open-banking/account-access-consents`\
    \ endpoint to allow clients to query the active consents against a given customer\
    \ (in relation to Bud's OB Aggregation service).\n\n**Version 1.7.6: 17/03/2021**\n\
    > - Addition of a new \"Regular Payment Changed\" Insight to the Warnings Endpoint\
    \ (that forms part of Bud's Signal Product).\n> - Bugfix: addition of the required\
    \ `mobile_phone_number` field to the request payload of the Switch Supplier endpoint\
    \ within the Energy Switching API to align to the implementation of the API itself.\n\
    > - Bugix: the format of the `annual_spend.amount` field within the request payload\
    \ of the kWh Estimation endpoint now states that is should be a number (as opposed\
    \ to a string) to align to the API itself.\n\n**Version 1.7.5: 10/02/2021**\n\
    > - Fixed bug in the List Accounts endpoint for Bud's OB Aggregation service -\
    \ the response data object now details all the returned fields as expected.\n\
    > - Removed the deprecated List Account Balances endpoint from the documentation\
    \ entirely.\n> - Added a new __Ingest Accounts__ endpoint within the Enrichment\
    \ API that allows clients to provide more detailed information regarding a customer's\
    \ account.\n\n**Version 1.7.4: 25/01/2021**\n> - Addition of a Know Your Customers\
    \ (KYC) API allowing clients to perform KYC checks on businesses or their customers.\n\
    > - \\[**BREAKING**\\] The `X-Customer-Secret` is now a required field within\
    \ the headers of the `/v1/open-banking/authorisation-gateway-url` endpoint. **Please\
    \ note that this change will only come into effect in three months time on the\
    \ 1st of May 2021**. All clients with exisitng integrations will be contacted\
    \ via email by their relevant account manager to inform them of this change. This\
    \ should provide clients with enough time adjust their integration before the\
    \ change coming into force. Please contact `help@thisisbud.com` or your account\
    \ manager if you have any questions, issues or concerns relating to this update.\n\
    \n**Version 1.7.3: 11/01/2021**\n> - Addition of the changelog to the api docs,\
    \ and further information around updates and versioning.\n> - Documentation Bug\
    \ Fix: `redirect_url` field is now shown as required within the **POST** `/v1/open-banking/authorisation-url`\
    \ endpoint. This affects those clients using Bud's TSP Aggregation Service.\n\n\
    **Version 1.7.2: 18/12/2020**\n> - Introduction of a new payment service within\
    \ Bud's Payment API. Clients are now able to initiate __Scheduled Payments__ from\
    \ Bud's Payments service. The scheduled payments service is available to those\
    \ clients using Bud as a TPP (i.e. via Bud Pay) and as a TSP.\n> - Bud have now\
    \ released their __First Party Transactions Ingestion__ endpoint. This allows\
    \ clients to simply post Bud some of their customer's transactions, which will\
    \ then be run through each of Bud's enrichment and insights services and then\
    \ stored securely. This opens up Bud's plethora of Insights services, Signal,\
    \ and Financial Review to those clients with first-party transactional data.\n\
    \n**Version 1.7.1: 06/12/2020**\n> - Few changes to the Payments endpoint responses,\
    \ including:\n>   - the GET providers endpoint, `required_actions` field now becomes\
    \ an array (as opposed to an object) and is populated with string enums which\
    \ are now clearly described in the schema.\n>   - the response of the create Single\
    \ Payment and Standing Order endpoints now includes a `required_action` field\
    \ as opposed to required_actions (since there will only ever be one next required\
    \ action). If this field appears within the response then clients must take another\
    \ action in order to complete the payment flow.\n>   - the payment status endpoint\
    \ also now includes the `required_action` field, which if not null, clearly indicates\
    \ that the client is required to perform the necessary action in order for the\
    \ payment to complete.\n>   - updated the payment service enums within the response\
    \ of the GET providers endpoint, since each provider can now potentially offer\
    \ `domestic-single-payment`, `domestic-standing-order` and (soon to be) `domestic-scheduled-payment`\
    \ services.\n> - Added extra information within the description of various Rent\
    \ Recognition endpoints. This should provide clients with a much clearer understanding\
    \ of which endpoints are needed and why in order to integrate the entire RR journey.\n\
    \n**Version 1.7.0: 27/11/2020**\n> - Added a new POST /v2/customers endpoint that\
    \ allows clients to create up to 200 customers in a single request.\n> - \\[**BREAKING**\\\
    ] Deprecated Financial Assistant endpoints (warnings / trends / forecast) and\
    \ introduced these endpoints under a new API called Signal with updated urls and\
    \ operation_ids.\n> - Altered description of the OB Aggregation TPP Retrieve Authorisation\
    \ Gateway URL to include for information into its usage.\n> - Introduction of\
    \ a new set of Payments based endpoints allowing customers to set up and authorise\
    \ standing orders from one of Bud’s supported providers. This comes in the form\
    \ of:\n>   - a new TPP endpoint, where clients can now request a new Bud Pay URL\
    \ to allows customers to set up a new standing order; and\n>   - a new set of\
    \ TSP endpoints, allowing clients to integrate Bud APIs to allow their customers\
    \ to initiate standing orders.\n\n**Version 1.6.5: 10/09/2020**\n> - Addition\
    \ of the `period` field to the __GET__ `/v1/salary` endpoint to provide an indication\
    \ into any regulatory associated with a predicted salary transaction.\n\n**Version:\
    \ 1.6.4: 06/08/2020**\n > - \\[**BREAKING**\\] Deprecated the use of `bank_name`\
    \ in relevant schemas within Bud’s OB Aggregation API in favour of of the field\
    \ `provider`\n > - Updated Affordability API title to Financial Review API and\
    \ provided an updated description of the API.\n > - Updated the product table\
    \ within the introduction to reflect new titles and descriptions across Bud’s\
    \ API services.\n\n**Version: 1.6.3 - 20/07/2020**\n > - Added a new endpoint\
    \ for the OB Aggregation TSP flow - __POST__ `/v1/open-banking/authorisation-codes`.\
    \ It allows clients to send back the parameters they receive from the bank once\
    \ the customer has completed the authorisation process. This allows Bud to match\
    \ the state to the relevant task id, and also provides the relevant code that\
    \ will allow Bud to start fetching the customer’s data from the provider.\n\n\
    **Version: 1.6.2 - 16/07/2020**\n > - Addition of international updates to payments\
    \ APIs\n > - Updated energy switching meters example to ensure that it will return\
    \ meter information for the address given in the example. \n\n**Version: 1.6.0\
    \ - 15/06/2020**\n > - Financial Assistant service added to the Insights API.\
    \ This includes three brand new endpoints that help customers to better manage\
    \ their financial world.\n >   - _Retrieve Warnings_: provides a list of potential\
    \ scenarios where a customer might suffer some financial expense (e.g. in their\
    \ overdraft, cannot cover bills, late payment and late income)\n >   - _Retrieve\
    \ Trends_: provides the key trends associated with a customer’s transactional\
    \ data broken down by month\n >   - _Retrieve Forecast_ - provides a list of the\
    \ regular and predicted transactions over a given period, noting whether they\
    \ are booked, pending or predicted.\n > - Affordability Service added to the documentation,\
    \ including a brand new endpoint to help clients to assess their customers affordability.\
    \ The _Create Spending Groups_ endpoint allows clients to create their own custom\
    \ group, e.g. Discretionary Spend, where they can select which of Bud’s categories\
    \ and/or subcategories will make up the group. All transactions for that customer\
    \ assigned to the categories/subcategories within the group will be bucketed up\
    \ and the client will be able to see the total income and expenditure in those\
    \ categories over a given period of time.\n\n**Version: 1.5.3 - 22/05/2020**\n\
    \ > - Added Payments: List Payment Status endpoint in order to retrieve paginated\
    \ details of multiple payment ids based on header filters\n > - General bug fixes\
    \ and improvements across examples, schemas, endpoints descriptions, names and\
    \ sectioning titles.\n\n**Version: 1.5.0 - 08/04/2020**\n > - Addition of Bud’\
    s Payment Initiation API. The endpoints provide clients with the functionality\
    \ to allow their customers to make payments from one of their bank accounts, to\
    \ a chosen recipient. In their first iteration, customers are able to authorise\
    \ a single payment from one of their UK based bank accounts to another UK bank\
    \ account.\n > - Addition of a Category Totals endpoint. The endpoint allows clients\
    \ to retrieve the total amount of money that is moving into and out of their customers'\
    \ connected bank accounts, broken down by transaction category. The endpoint breaks\
    \ the totals down by both tier 1 and tier 2 type categories (as is provided by\
    \ Buds dual layered categorisation engine).\n > - Acceptance of a new transaction\
    \ schema format for all 1st Party Enrichment Endpoints. All of Bud’s first party\
    \ data enrichment endpoints (i.e. __POST__`/v1/categorise/double-cat`, __POST__`/v1/regular-payments`,\
    \ __POST__`/v1/merchants`) are now able to accept the transaction format outputted\
    \ by TrueLayer. This makes it even easier for those clients who are using TrueLayer\
    \ as an aggregator to get the use of Bud’s enrichment services.\n\n# Authentication\n\

    \ which returns a link to Bud’s pre-built Open Banking customer connection journey\
    \ that can be configured to your brand.\n\n  2. If you have your own license you\
    \ can choose to host the Open Banking customer connection journey yourself, using\
    \ [Bud's APIs](#operation/open_banking_authorisation_url_post) to create the connection.\
    \ __If you are an agent of Bud but feel that your application could benefit from\
    \ a more native feel please talk to your Bud Account Manager or email help@thisisbud.com\

    \ push your data onto the Bud platform without needing your customers to connect\
    \ their accounts via Open Banking. \n  \nNote: a number of the calls within this\
    \ service are asynchronous, and as such, follow a pattern of sending a request\

    These endpoints allow Bud's Clients to initiate (i.e. make) payments through the use of Open Banking Payment APIs.
    Bud manages the connections to each of the payment providers, and serves these connections under a single set of API endpoints, enabling Bud's clients (and in turn their customers) to initiate a payment from one of these providers to a chosen recipient.

    Bud currently supports two methods for initiating payments with available providers:

      1. If you are not regulated to provide payment initiation services, or if you are regulated but do not wish to use
      your own permissions, then use Bud's [TPP Initiation](#tag/TPP-Initiation) endpoints.
      2. If on the other hand, your are regulated as an Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP), then you are able to use Bud
      as a Technical Service Provider (see [TSP Initiation](#tag/TSP-Initiation)).

      description: |
        When using Bud as a TSP (Technical Service Provider) and doing full app-to-app authorisation, the customer is returned from the provider directly back to your app. Your app will then need to send all the query and hash fragment parameters to Bud so that we can complete the connection.

        Query and fragment parameters should be merged with query taking precedence. If you receive a request `/path?a=1#a=2&b=3` then you should perform this request with `{"a":"1","b":"3"}`. Given the nature of the fragment queries most server side languages will not process these so javascript may be required to correctly gather both parameters.

        Regardless of what parameters are present, all of them should be sent to Bud so that we can choose to either continue the connection or to map and record the error.

        Code and error are shown here only because they are the most common parameters you will see, but this object could contain any number of unspecified properties. Currently state is a common property among all authorisation flows and is the current task ID. The state property is not guaranteed for the future of this API contract and will not be treated as backwards incompatible if a new authentication flow does not use it.

The complete enrichment services applied to the data will depend upon the relevant scopes assigned to your Client ID.

        If a 'X-Disable-Synchronous' header is present and set to true, the process will be entirely 'non-blocking', with the returned Task ID providing access to the status of the full enrichment process.

        List the balances of each bank account for a customer accross all ingestion sources. Ordered by balance date.

        It calculates the balance for each date, by iterating from the date the account was last refreshed to the `to` and `from` dates provided. It then checks all the transactions within this range, calculating the balance at the end of each day.

        This endpoint limits the date from which it gets balances from either by the oldest `transaction_window` on the account if they are present, or by the oldest transaction within the requested date range available.

        For users ingesting data via the `Ingest Accounts` endpoint, you can increase the range and accuracy of the data supplied from this service by including the transaction_window field upon acccount ingestion.

        By default this endpoint will return the last 3 months of transactions unless a valid `from` and `to` range is given (*where `from` is older than `to`).

        **Please note: support will cease for this endpoint on the 1st of August 2023 - please complete your migration to the Retrieve Transactions V2 endpoint by that point in time. For further details, contact your Bud account manager or email `help@thisisbud.com`.**

        Provides a list of a customer's income based transactions found within their connected accounts, and predicts whether each income transaction is related to a customer's `salary_or_wages`. Any income which is not salary or wages is given the type `other_income`, which can include other income sources such as investments or pension income.

        **Notes:**
        - Transactions are filtered to return the latest income transaction per transaction reference. For instance, if the customer has 4 salary transactions all with the same reference of `Monthly Salary`, only the latest will be returned.

      description: |
        Provides a list of a customer's income based transactions found within their connected accounts, and predicts whether each income transaction is related to a customer's `salary_or_wages`. Any income which is not salary or wages is given the type `other_incoming`, which can include other income sources such as investments or pension income.

        **Notes:**
        - Transactions with multiple currencies are supported, but the statistics are currently only calculated for one currency. The endpoint takes the currency of the first transaction and ignores non-matching currencies in its calculations.
        - In contrast to the V1 endpoint, Income Finder V2 no longer filters income transactions to only return the latest per reference.

      summary: Submit Authorisation Codes
      description: |
        When using Bud as a TSP (Technical Service Provider) and doing full app-to-app authorisation, the customer is returned from the provider directly back to your app. Your app will then need to send all the query and hash fragment parameters to Bud so that we can continue with the payment flow.

        Query and fragment parameters should be merged with query taking precedence. If you receive a request /path?a=1#a=2&b=3 then you should perform this request with {"a":"1","b":"3"}. Given the nature of the fragment queries most server side languages will not process these so javascript may be required to correctly gather both parameters.

        Regardless of what parameters are present, all of them should be sent to Bud so that we can choose to either continue the connection or to map and record the error.

        State, Code and error are the most common parameters you will see, but this object may contain any number of unspecified properties. Currently state is a common property among all authorisation flows and is the current task ID. The state property is not guaranteed for the future of this API contract and will not be treated as backwards incompatible if a new authentication flow does not use it.

        | `cannot_cover_bills`            | The total upcoming payments for exceeds the current balance. The time range used for analysing past payments is `(X-From, X-Today)` and the period used for predicting upcoming payments is `(X-Today, X-To)`. |
        | `late_income`                   | A regular incoming payment was expected to be received on the account and hasn't yet. |
        | `late_payment`                  | A regular outgoing payment that was expected to come out of the account on a specific date but has been paid after expected date.  |
        | `regular_payment_changed`       | The value of a regular payment has increased or decreased between the oldest and newest instance. |
        | `suspected_duplicate_charge`    | A duplicate transaction is one of more transactions that are debit transactions, have a non-zero booking time, and have a non-zero amount. They must also have matching `account_id`, `transaction_reference`, `merchant_id` (if one exists), `amount`, `currency`, `date`, `booking_datetime`. |
        | `regular_monthly_income_change` | The value of a regular income has increased or decreased based on the previous months income. As this is comparing income over whole months, only complete months are considered in the provided date range. For instance, if `X-From=2022-01-05` and `X-To=2022-04-05` then the range considered by this warning will be `(2022-01-01, 2022-03-31)`. In addition, the default treshold for a difference in amounts to trigger this warning is 10%. |

They must also have matching `account_id`, `transaction_reference`, `merchant_id` (if one exists), `amount`, `currency`, `date`, `booking_datetime`. |
        | `regular_monthly_income_change` | The value of a regular income has increased or decreased based on the previous months income. As this is comparing income over whole months, only complete months are considered in the provided date range. For instance, if `X-From=2022-01-05` and `X-To=2022-04-05` then the range considered by this warning will be `(2022-01-01, 2022-03-31)`. In addition, the default treshold for a difference in amounts to trigger this warning is 10%. |

        Authentication flow:

        1. Perform OAuth2 Client Credentials authentication using API Credentials (`client_id`,`client_secret`) to obtain an `access_token` against `/v1/oauth/token` endpoint,
        2. Use `access_token` as Bearer Authorisation for every other API request,
        3. Include `X-Client-Id` (=client_id) within the header of every API request
        4. Note that some of the requests may also require `X-Customer-Id` or `X-Customer-Id` and `X-Customer-Secret` to be provided within the request header.

        ### Examples
        Obtain OAuth2 `access_token` and `refresh_token` using `grant_type=client_credentials` and HTTP Basic auth header

        ```
        curl --basic --user {{client_id}}:{{client_secret}} \

          }
        }
        ```

        Refresh `access_token` token using `refresh_token` against `/v1/oauth/token` endpoint with `grant_type=refresh_token`

        ```
        curl -X POST \
