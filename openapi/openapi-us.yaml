    ## Message formats

    Bud’s platform is made available through Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints, all of which adhere to [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/) principles. Standard HTTP verbs and status codes are used for requests and response statuses. Request and response payloads are [JSON](http://www.json.org/) encoded data formatted. Communication with the Bud Platform is handled over HTTPS protocol only.

    | GET | Used to retrieve the resource representation or metadata |
    | POST | Used to create a new resource on the server |
    | PUT | Used to update the resource state |

    | `5XX` | Server Error - the request has not been processed due to server-side issue |

    ## Requests Custom Headers

    Some endpoints will require the presence of custom headers in the HTTP Request to be properly processed by Bud Platform services.

    | Header Name | Description|

    # Updates & Versioning
    Updates to Bud's API documentation are made frequently. The current version of the documentation can be clearly viewed at the very top of this page.

    ## Backward Compatibility

    Bud aims to make integration as seamless as possible for its clients and therefore takes all possible steps to prevent backward-compatibility breaks. In the scenario where a backward-compatibility break is unavoidable, Bud creates a new endpoint, either: (a) by bumping the version within the endpoint URL; or (b) in some circumstances renaming the URL entirely. The previous endpoint may then become deprecated, and support for the endpoint will cease after a period of three months. Clients with access to any of Bud’s API services will be notified of deprecations to any endpoints and provided with ample time in which to make any necessary changes.

    Fields within response or request schemas may also become deprecated. Along with deprecated endpoints, these breaking changes will be clearly highlighted within the below changelog.

    ## Deprecations

    Bud will continue to support deprecations for a period of **three months** after they are first announced.

    | Date of Announcement | Deprecation Details                                                                                               |

    description: |
      These endpoints handle the connections to banking providers and the ingestion of first party transaction data. Bud manages all of the connections to each of the individual providers and enables access to all of the providers via a single set of API endpoints.

      Bud currently supports three methods of connecting your customers data to the Bud platform:

        1. You can use the [__Bud Connect__](#operation/v2_ob_authorisation_gateway_url_post) endpoint which returns a link to Bud’s pre-built customer connection journey that can be configured to your brand.

        2. If you have your own license you can choose to host the customer connection journey yourself, using [Bud's APIs](#operation/open_banking_authorisation_url_post) to create the connection. __If you are an agent of Bud but feel that your application could benefit from a more native feel please talk to your Bud Account Manager or email help@thisisbud.com for further details.__

        3. If you already have transactional data that you’re looking to enrich, you can use Bud’s [Ingest Endpoints](#tag/Ingest-Data) to push your data onto the Bud platform without needing your customers to connect their accounts 
        
      Note: a number of the calls within this service are asynchronous, and as such, follow a pattern of sending a request and responding with a task ID. This task ID can then be tracked, allowing for a more efficient, cross network implementation.

        This endpoint is used to create access and refresh tokens. 

        The access token is used as a bearer token to authenticate requests to Bud endpoints; 
        the refresh token is used to generate a new access token without the need to supply your client credentials again.

        The access token usually expires after the `expires_in` time (in seconds) has elapsed. 
        However this is not guaranteed, so it is recomended to integrate such as to handle the `401` response code and refresh the token when it this response code is seen.

        Refresh tokens typically expire after 24 hours, but this is not guaranteed.

        > **🚧** Recognise the sensitive nature of access tokens. Implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

        This endpoint is used to create a new Customer in order for them to consume the Bud services.

        When we refer to a Customer, we're talking about the end-user of yours and Bud's technology. Customer entities in Bud have unique identifiers and this is used to store the customer data on the Bud platform.

        For more information on how to manage your Bud Customers, please, refer to the following [guide](https://docs-us.thisisbud.com/docs/setup-customers)

        > 📘 Note:
        >
        > By specifying a `client_metadata.idempotent_identifier` value, Bud will associate that identifier to a Customer, 
        > and in future Bud will return the same Customer entity everytime we receive the same `idempotent_identifier` value.
        >
        > This allows you to associate your internal resource to the concept of the Bud Customer.
        >
        > On subsequent requests for a customer with a given `idempotent_identifier`, Bud will return a 200 status code instead of a 201.
        >
        > Please, make sure the `idempotent_identifier` is immutable on your application.

        Customers are listed ordered by their ID. Deleted customers will not be included in the list.

        The list of customers can be filtered by creation date with the `date_from` and `date_to` query parameters, which expect dates in the RFC3339 format.

        If more results pages are available, the response metadata object will contain a  `next_page_token` field which can be used to fetch the next page of results. The token should be provided in the `page_token` query parameter for subsequent requests.

      description: |
        Allow customers to authorise with, and connect to, a provider, using Bud’s __Bud Connect__. Bud Connect is a UI component hosted by Bud that can be integrated into any mobile or web experience, and 
        allows your customers to connect to and authorise with their chosen provider, allowing Bud to pull their account information.

        Using the different configuration options that can be set through the request body you can personalize the experience for your Customer. Please, refer to the documentation below for more information about the available configurations.

        The status of the authorisation step will be provided to you as a path parameter within the `redirect_url` specified within the request payload. 
        This `redirect_url` is where your customer will be redirected to once they have either failed, or successfully completed, the authorisation process with their provider.

        The URL generated with this endpoint is valid for up to 30 minutes. We suggest to generate the URL right before redirecting your Customer to it.

        Please note that in order to recieve status updates on a given account connection task, you will need to configure your Callback URL within the developer console. 
        Once the entire connection process has been completed and the customer's account information is ready to be collected, Bud will send a request to your callback URL.

        Instruct Bud to retrieve the latest account information for a customer. Refresh the accounts from a single provider with an existing connection.

        By default this task will retrieve transactions since the last pull of transactions less seven days. This can be overridden using the `from` body parameter to a maximum of 90 days previously.

        After initiating this long running process, make sure to check the status of the it till completion before trying to access the Customer's data or initiating another refresh.

        If the customer's provider was fetched (connect or refresh) within the last hour, the endpoint will return the task_id of the previous task instead of refreshing the data again.

        If the customer's consent has been revoked or expired for this provider, Bud will be unable to refresh the account. 
        This will be confirmed in the response of the refresh status endpoint associated with the `task_id` provided in the response to this endpoint, where the `reconnect_required` field will set to `true` and status set to `Completed`.

      description: |
        Check the status of an account information refresh task. If the task is not yet completed, the status will be shown as pending. 
        If the status is completed, then the data is ready to be collected via the [Retrieve Financial Data](/reference/retrieve-financial-data) endpoints. 
        Successful requests will include `step` (1-4) and associated `text` values to indicate the current progress of the refresh task.

        Make sure to check the status of the task till completion before trying to access the Customer's data or initiating another process.

        When the task is successful, we include in the response body a `metadata.has_new_transactions` boolean attribute that tells you if the refresh resulted in storing new data. This attribute must be used to 
        decide if it's necessary to pull the Customer's data or not.

        When the refresh fails, we include the reason of the failure as part of the `data.result` attribute. We also include the `data.reconnect_required` boolean attribute that indicates if the consent used to 
        fetch the data for this customer and provider is no longer valid. If reconnect_required is true, the customer will need to go through the bank account connection flow again.

      description: |
        Instruct Bud to retrieve the latest account information for a customer. Refresh the accounts from all providers with an existing connection.

        By default this task will retrieve transactions since the last pull of transactions less seven days. This can be overridden using the `from` body parameter to a maximum of 90 days previously.
        On completion of this task Bud will send a webhook to your configured endpoint including details of the refresh completed and the status of the refresh for each provider. Alternatively the status of the task can be checked using the Retrieve Refresh Status V2 endpoint. Please check that the task has completed successfully before trying to access the Customer's data or initiating another refresh.

        If a similar refresh (same providers) for this customer has been initiated within the last hour, the endpoint will return the task_id of the previous task instead of refreshing the data again.

        If the customer's consent has been revoked or expired for a provider, Bud will be unable to refresh the customers account at that provider. 
        This will be confirmed in the response of the refresh status endpoint associated with the `task_id` provided in the response to this endpoint, where the `reconnect_required` field will set to `true` and status set to `Completed`. If the consent within the Bud system was marked as `Authorised` at this point the consent will be updated to `Revoked` 

        To simplify your integration Bud is able to take control of your background refreshes and manage these regularly for you. Full details can be found on the following [guide](https://docs.thisisbud.com/docs/open-banking-hosted-refreshes)

      summary: Retrieve Refresh Status V2
      description: |
        Check the status of an account information refresh task. If the task is not yet completed, the status will be shown as pending. 
        If the status is completed, then the data is ready to be collected via the [Retrieve Financial Data](/reference/retrieve-financial-data) endpoints. 

        To monitor the status of a refresh task we provide two methods. The preferred approach is to utilise the webhook functionality within the Bud platform where Bud will send a webhook to your configured endpoint when the task completes. Alternatively you can poll this endpoint to retrieve the status of the task.
        Please ensure that you either receive a webhook with a status of `Completed` and result of `success` or this endpoint returns a status of `Completed` and result of `success` before trying to access the Customer's data or initiating another process.

        When the task is successful, we include in the response body a `metadata.has_new_transactions` boolean attribute that tells you if the refresh resulted in storing new data. This attribute must be used to 
        decide if it's necessary to pull the Customer's data or not.

        When the refresh fails, we include the reason of the failure as part of the `data.result` attribute. We also include the `data.sub_tasks[i].reconnect_required` boolean attribute that indicates if the consent used to 
        fetch the data for this customer and provider is no longer valid. If reconnect_required is true, the customer will need to go through the bank account connection flow and the consent will be marked as revoked.

        When only a subset of sub tasks fails the main task will be marked as `Failed` but for each provider where the refresh was successful (result is equal to `success`) customers data will be updated and available from the [Retrieve Financial Data](/reference/retrieve-financial-data) endpoints.
        In the case of a partial success you are able to specify the `providers` body parameter to the [Initiate Refresh V2](/reference/v2_open_banking_refresh_post) endpoint to initiate a refresh for the failing provider(s).

        Start a task to remove consent and remove Bud’s ability to download further information for a specified customer account.

        This will revoke `all` the consents for the specified provider associated to the customer.

        To check the status of this task, use the `Retrieve Revoke Consent Status` using the returned `task_id`.

        Alternatively, there is a `Open Banking Consent Revoked` webhook that will trigger per consent successfully revoked. As such this task could generate multiple of these.

        It can ingest data for multiple customers per request.
        By default, this is synchronous and will report any issue with the data in the response.
        If a 'X-Disable-Synchronous' header is present and set to true, the process will create a task in the background and be entirely 'non-blocking'.
        In this scenario, the response metadata will contain a Task ID and the next URL which would then be used for finding out the operation's result.

      description: |
        This endpoint should be used to ingest customer transactions into the Bud Platform.

        By default, this endpoint is synchronous but can be easily switched to asynchronous using the 'X-Disable-Synchronous' header. 
        Please refer to the following [guide](https://docs-us.thisisbud.com/docs/setup_data_enrichment) to ensure you set up First Party Ingestion 
        correctly for your organisation based on your use case.

        We accept a maximum of 1.000 transactions. If this threshold is not respected, a 400 error is returned.

        We support the ingestion of transactions for multiple customers as part of the same request.

        The detailed location enrichment response is an additional addon, otherwise only tokens are returned 
        (read more about this in the location [guide](https://docs-us.thisisbud.com/docs/locations).

      summary: Retrieve Balances Over Time
      description: |
        List the balances of each bank account for a customer across all ingestion sources. Ordered by balance date.

        It calculates the balance for each date, by iterating from the date the account was last refreshed to the `to` 
        and `from` dates provided. It then checks all the transactions within this range, calculating the balance at 
        the end of each day.

        This endpoint limits the date from which it gets balances by the oldest `transaction_window` on the 
        account. If `transaction_windows` are not present, it is not possible to calculate balances and the endpoint
        returns an empty list.

        You can only request balances within transaction windows, therefore if you ingest transactions without a

      description: |
        List the balances of a specific bank account for a customer across all ingestion sources. Ordered by balance 
        date.

        It calculates the balance for each date, by iterating from the date the account was last refreshed to the `to` 
        and `from` dates provided. It then checks all the transactions within this range, calculating the balance at 
        the end of each day.

        This endpoint limits the date from which it gets balances by the oldest `transaction_window` on the 
        account. If `transaction_windows` are not present, it is not possible to calculate balances and the endpoint
        returns an empty list.

        You can only request balances within transaction windows, therefore if you ingest transactions without a 
        transaction window, you won't be able to request balance for that time range. However those transactions will be
        used to calculate the balance as well.

        For users ingesting data via the `Ingest Accounts` endpoint, you can increase the range and accuracy of the

      summary: Retrieve Balances Over Time By Account
      description: |
        List the balances of a specific bank account for a customer across all ingestion sources. Ordered by balance  date.
        It calculates the balance for each date, by iterating from the date the account was last refreshed to the `to`  and `from` dates provided. It then checks all the transactions within this range, calculating the balance at  the end of each day.
        This endpoint limits the date from which it gets balances by the oldest `transaction_window` on the  account. If `transaction_windows` are not present, it is not possible to calculate balances and the endpoint returns an empty list.
        You can only request balances within transaction windows, therefore if you ingest transactions without a  transaction window, you won't be able to request balance for that time range. However those transactions will be used to calculate the balance as well.
        For users ingesting data via the `Ingest Accounts` endpoint, you can increase the range and accuracy of the  data supplied from this service by including the transaction_window field upon account ingestion.
        The balances selected to use as latest pending & latest booked in the calculation are selected according to a provider specific balance type priority list.
        Results are limited to up to 5000 balance items.

            The `updated_after` parameter lets you retrieve transactions that have been modified since  a specific date and time. This format should follow the RFC3339 standard (e.g., "2024-06-01T11:00:00Z").
            This parameter is particularly useful for keeping local copies of transactions up-to-date. By storing the  timestamp of your last successful fetch, you can request only transactions updated after that point during  subsequent retrievals. 
            This approach ensures you only fetch the latest changes, making the process more streamlined.

        If `include_similar` is set to `true`, then all previous and future transactions (i.e. those that are yet to happen yet) that are similar in nature to the specified transaction id will be corrected with the provided category and/or subcategory.

        Similar transactions are determined based on transactions with similar descriptions & amounts.

        This endpoint is used to find similar transactions to the *source* transaction. Similar transactions are  determined based on transactions with similar descriptions & amounts to the source transaction.

        There will **not** be any duplicate transactions in the response. 

        Use the `exclude_source` query parameter to toggle whether the endpoint returns the source transaction in the response. By **default** it will.

        For example if there are **no** similar transactions to transaction A:

        > `exclude_source = true`
        >> The response will contain **0** transactions

        > `exclude_source = false` or not present (**default**)
        >> The response will contain **1** transaction, that being the source transaction A

      summary: Similar Transactions Including Merchants
      description: |-
        This endpoint is used to find similar transactions to the *source* transaction. Similar transactions are  determined based on transactions with similar descriptions & amounts to the source transaction. In addition, transactions that also have the same merchant are returned. 

        There will **not** be any duplicate transactions in the response. 

        Use the `exclude_source` query parameter to toggle whether the endpoint returns the source transaction in the response. By **default** it will.

        For example if there are **no** similar transactions to transaction A:

        > `exclude_source = true`
        >> The response will contain **0** transactions

        > `exclude_source = false` or not present (**default**)
        >> The response will contain **1** transaction, that being the source transaction A

      description: |
        Provides a list of a customer's income based transactions found within their connected accounts, and predicts whether each income transaction is related to a customer's `salary_or_wages`. Any income which is not salary or wages is given the type `other_incoming`, which can include other income sources such as investments or pension income.

        When `X-From` is omitted from the request, a default value of 9 months from before today's date will be used.
        When `X-To` is omitted from the request, a default value of today's date will be used.

        **Notes:**
        - Transactions with multiple currencies are supported, but the statistics are currently only calculated for one currency. The endpoint takes the currency of the first transaction and ignores non-matching currencies in its calculations.
        - In contrast to the V1 endpoint, Income Finder V2 no longer filters income transactions to only return the latest per reference.

      description: |
        Create a savings goal for the given account id.

        Of the fields `target_amount`, `target_datetime` and `recurrent_amount`, only two are required. If two are supplied then the third parameter will be calculated in the response.

        For example:
          If the date the goal is created is `2023-01-01T00:00:00Z`, if a savings goal is created with the `target_amount` of `$110`, and the `target_datetime` is `2023-12-01T00:00:00Z`, then the recurrent amount will be `$10`.

        When performing this calculation, it is assumed that a customer is not going to deposit their first savings payment within the month of creating the goal.
        If this is the desired behaviour however, all three parameters can be supplied and the endpoint will accept this.

        Authentication flow:

        1. Perform OAuth2 Client Credentials authentication using API Credentials (`client_id`,`client_secret`) to obtain an `access_token` against `/v1/oauth/token` endpoint,
        2. Use `access_token` as Bearer Authorisation for every other API request,
        3. Include `X-Client-Id` (=client_id) within the header of every API request,
        4. Note that some of the requests may also require `X-Customer-Id` to be provided within the request header.

        ### Examples
        Obtain OAuth2 `access_token` and `refresh_token` using `grant_type=client_credentials` and HTTP Basic auth header

        ```
        curl --basic --user {{client_id}}:{{client_secret}} \
          -X POST https://api-sandbox.thisisbud.com/v1/oauth/token \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
          -d grant_type=client_credentials

          }
        }
        ```

        Refresh `access_token` token using `refresh_token` against `/v1/oauth/token` endpoint with `grant_type=refresh_token`

        ```
        curl -X POST \
          https://api-sandbox.thisisbud.com/v1/oauth/token \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
